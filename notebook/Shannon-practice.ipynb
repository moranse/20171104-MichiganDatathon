You will awake each morning to the smell of fresh brewed coffee - roasted here by me from exotic green beans. Pair this with some fresh baked artisan bread that I typically have on hand. If you love coffee and fresh home made bread, it doesn't get any better than this. I've also recently begun to make simple cheeses. If you are interested, I might give you a lesson or two on how to roast your own coffee. In addition to fresh baked bread toasted with jam additional breakfast offerings may include cereal, bagels with cream cheese, or, on occassion, a Colombian breakfast of arepa, egg, and cheese. It's delicioso and high protein breakfast, a great way to start the day.
