# Summary

This project for EECS 545 uses machine learning to analyze data from the MiniBooNE experiment to distinguish signal events from background events. Boosted Decision Trees and Artificial Neural Networks will be used for analysis.

## Data Set Information

The submitted file is set up as follows. In the first line is the the number of signal events followed by the number of background events. The signal events come first, followed by the background events. Each line, after the first line has the 50 particle ID variables for one event.

## Attribute Information

50 particle ID variables (real) for each event.
